### v2.0.0

This is a major rewrite of the internals.  Externally there are fewer
changes:

* On node>0.8 gauge object now prints updates at a fixed rate.  This means
  that when you call `show` it may wate up to `updateInterval` ms before it
  actually prints an update.  You override this behavior with the
  `fixedFramerate` option.
* The gauge object now keeps the cursor hidden as long as it's enabled and
  shown.
* The constructor's arguments have changed, now it takes a mandatory output
  stream and an optional options object.  The stream no longer needs to be
  an `ansi`ified stream, although it can be if you want (but we won't make
  use of its special features).
* Previously the gauge was disabled by default if `process.stdout` wasn't a
  tty.  Now it always defaults to enabled.  If you want the previous
  behavior set the `enabled` option to `process.stdout.isTTY`.
* The constructor's options have changedâ€“ see the docs for details.
* Themes are entirely different.  If you were using a custom theme, or
  referring to one directly (eg via `Gauge.unicode` or `Gauge.ascii`) then
  you'll need to change your code.  You can get the equivalent of the latter
  with:
  ```
  var themes = require('gauge/themes')
  var unicodeTheme = themes(true, true) // returns the color unicode theme for your platform
  ```
  The default themes no longer use any ambiguous width characters, so even
  if you choose to display those as wide your progress bar should still
  display correctly.
* Templates are entirely different and if you were using a custom one, you
  should consult the documentation to learn how to recreate it.  If you were
  using the default, be aware that it has changed and the result looks quite
  a bit different.
